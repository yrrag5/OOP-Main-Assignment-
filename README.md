//	Description

This API focuses on comparing two text files using abstraction, encapsulation, 
composition and inheritance.

//	Program Steps

The class Runner is the class the must be run in order to start the program, this
will bring you to a menu to parse and compare the documents that you wish to use
in the program. You will then be prompted to enter the text file name (test1.txt)
and to give a shingle size. This will then output results with the number of shingles
each file, comparisons and percentage of occurences.

!! Errors occur when entering shingle and blocking queue size and was unable to resolve. 

!! Package name is oop so oop.jar command would be (java â€“cp ./oop.jar ie.gmit.oop.Runner)

!! Unfortunately my jre1.8.0_151 did not contain the javadoc.exe so I could not generate
any JavaDocs for this project.
